	<h3>working on stuff for fun, and moving on when it gets boring</h3>
	<p>i do personal projects and sometimes mess around with open source. coding is just a way to spend time when i’m bored or feeling inspired. if i get tired of something, i just drop it and go find something else to do. it’s all about having fun, no pressure.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>i wake up super early, like 4-5am, and go to bed at 8-9pm. guess i’m a morning person lol.</li>
		<li>most of my projects are just random stuff i feel like building. sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t. idc.</li>
		<li>if something catches my eye in open source, i’ll probably contribute for fun.</li>
		<li>honestly, i’m just here to try new things and learn. no fancy plans, just enjoying the ride.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>check out my stuff if you want, but don’t expect everything to be perfect. i’m just doing this for fun!</p>
